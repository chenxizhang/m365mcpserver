I want to build a world-class MCP server to allow users to interact with Microsoft 365 services seamlessly and efficiently by using the Microsoft Graph API. 

The differentiation factor for this MCP server will be its ability to provide a unified and consistent interface for accessing all Microsoft 365 services (reference to openapi specs in `specs` folder), along with advanced features such as intelligent data processing, personalized user experiences, and robust security measures.
